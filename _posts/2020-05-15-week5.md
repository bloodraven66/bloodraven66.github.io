It's time for the weekly update once again! I've been noticing something weird actually. Most of time it's as if time is on 2x. When I hear someone talk, the words zoom through but I can follow easily. Even now, when I am typing while listing to a song, it feels the song is soo fast. Side effect of studying, eh? Tell me touch up on it again next week.
So it was a good week, finished the intro to algorithms MIT course and should do the advanced one next week. Also got in a good number of problems solved on leetcode. The DUSL homeworks are almost done, lots of new coding so going sluggish. Also started reading a lot of papers. Basically, read, understand, summarise on evernote. Aiming for 50-75 good ones by next week. Areas - adversarial, self-supervised learning, domain adaptation. Alright, it's time to list of unravel and hit leetcode again.
