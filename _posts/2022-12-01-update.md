Blog update
<!--more-->
Archived my previous blogs. 

I was spending too much time adding images for equations and figures, and not really happy with the how it turrned out. Once I transistion to a better approach (I'm thinking something along the lines of a mix of markdown + writeups on tab) and can dedicate more time towards this, I'll be back to blogging!

Nowadays I'm mainly busy managing my work, research along with organising a challenge (LIMMITS 23) and taking part in one (SLT hackthon).
