How can one stitch together different views of a scene into a video with neural networks?  Neural View Synthesis!
<!--more-->

In this post, I will go through some of the recent work in the field of view synthesis with neural networks.

Papers covered:
<li>NeRF: Representing Scenes as Neural Radiance Fields for View Synthesis</li>
<li>Nerf in the wild: Neural radiance fields for unconstrained photo collections</li>
<li>Graf: Generative radiance fields for 3d-aware image synthesis</li>
<li>Free view synthesis</li>
<li>pixelnerf: Neural radiance fields from one or few images</li>
