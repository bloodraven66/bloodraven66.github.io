The start of my AI research blog, Day 1 :D

<!--more-->

First blog of 2020! I have written a few before on medium and blogger, shifting to github pages for good :D

Ok so, who am I and what do I do?
I completed my engineering in July 2019 and I worked as a ML engineer for 9 months or so. Then I left my job to pursue AI research. Today I started studying and researching on my own full-time. This is going to be a series of blog posts, at the end of every week I will write about the things I learnt, worked on and share my ideas. Are you ready? Lets goooo!

First, where do I stand today, April 10?
I am pretty solid in DL with good pytorch skills in CV, NLP, Speech and with good intuition on model building. ML Math? Well, I love math but it's been a while since I practiced ML math. Programming? pretty good but the only competitive coding I did was for 4 days when I was preparing for an AI residency round.

Focus Areas for next few weeks?
1. Loads of coding! Leetcode in C and python throughout to get better in it.
2. Then, a lot of advanced ml courses with a lot of math! Lots of general topics to learn like bayesian ml, statistical optimization, RL etc.  
3. Now, a good amount of actual research. Complete some pending research work and try new ideas on a college project.
4. Read papers! Implement! Hopefully while doing these, I'll keep thinking of novel approaches, experiment on them.
5. Blogs! Atleast one blog a week with the update and more blogs on things I find interesting.
6. One serious kaggle competition. Never went try hard on any, need to pick a competition, pour in some blood and sweat, get those glands and marrows into overtime.
