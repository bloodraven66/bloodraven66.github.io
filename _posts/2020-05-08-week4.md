<!--more-->
Mostly spent the between writing (almost) final drafts of 2 papers and running more experiments, Berkeley DUSL homeworks- mostly paper implementations, leetcode!
Next week focus going to be on auditing some CS courses to solidify basics, mainly discrete mathematics and DS, from MIT opencourseware(~75 hrs) and then read the CLRS. Also continue the homeworks and put in more leetcode time. More next week, adios.
