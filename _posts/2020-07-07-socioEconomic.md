So this week I was watching an ongoing netflix originals show named Snowpiercer. It's based on a French graphic novel called Le Transperceneige, created by Jacques Lob and Jean-Marc Rochette in 1982. There was also a movie adaptation few years back, starring Chris Evans. My thoughts are on the netflix show, spoiler alert needless to say.

The world is set into an artifical ice-age while trying to combat global warming and the only survivors are on a train which has been going around the world for 7 years now. The train is 1001 cars long and it houses and produces the resources to keep the 1000+ humans on it alive. These people are divided into 4 casses. The first class comprises of the wealthy, the ones who gave their fortune to build the train. The second class are the people with white collar jobs - doctors, scientists etc and the third class are the everyday working class people. Then there is the tail, a large number of people who fought their way into the train while it was departing. 

The train is owned by Wilford Industries and supposedly managed by Mr. Wilford who has confined himself to the engine. People stay in line obeying whatever Wilford says, for he is their savior. Melanie, an engineer who actually built the train and works in train management, acts as Wilfords voice and will to the people in the train. 7 years later, people find out Wilford was killed before departure and it was Melanie running the train all along. 

Now that the world has set in, we can look at the problems arising in the train. Most of the people despise the tail, as those people werent supposed to be on the train and they are draining the train of resources. The tail wants better quality of life and equal oppurtunity. There is also the issue of management favouring first class over third in disputes. The third keeps the train running while the first made it possible for the train to exist. Who gets more power here? Then there is the issue of Melanie being exposed of Wilford's absence in the train. While people obediently followed orders believing it was Wilford in-charge, now they hate everything she did and want her removed. Where is justice in that? She was the one who kept the train alive all these years?

Now there is a difference between how things are in the real-world and how it is in the train. The train is humanity's last hope, it cannot stop running, the people in it must not die, the resourses must not stop producing. That is the bottom line, survival. But would people on the train really see that? The tail after being confined there, starving, breeding and eating rats, killed for attempting riots, enter into their mindset, who be willing to go along with the status quo? For the management, there arn't supposed to be on the train. If one is being pragmatic, the train would be better off without the tail. The tails demand for more resources starts the class diviosions with third demanding more. The thing is, there is room on the train for the tail with the sumptuous life led by first. Then the question arises, would you strip them of their luxury for the tail to lead a life? I don't see people doing that. One could argue that they gave up their fortune to build the train so they have a right towards whatever they want. But then there is a counterarguement that they are alive which itself is a big deal, they don't get to ask for more now.

We see similar things in the arks in the movie '2012'. Rich peeps with spacious quaters and not letting commoners in, citing lack of space. What is missing is the aspect of humanity, though you give in to that and all don't support it then you have socio-economic clashes in the highest class and the ociety you intent to build falls apart.

In an ideal world on a ark-like situation with a cap on people to take along, what would be your selection criteria? A group of people to ensure survival - doctors, engineers, scientists. People to manage and keep society in line - leaders, lawyers, police. The working class to keep everything running. Artists, entertainers, writers to bring people together, keep them happy. Is that it? Now think what would actually happen? If you werent skilled in anything, would you not try to get on it? when it comes to survival, everyman to himself isn't it? No one is gonna think about the bigger picture, there are gonna be a few like Melanie who try to hold everything together but it is going to fall apart, that is human nature. 

That is the societal order at its worst and I hope it doesn't come to that. Thought you would get some answers here? Nah, I just throw out more questions. If you are pragmatic enough, you will get the answers but you won't get the majority to agree with you. Good luck with that.
