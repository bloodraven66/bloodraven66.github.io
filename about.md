I enjoy learning more and working in different research fields - Speech(Production, TTS, ASR), Vision(Unsupervised), Reinforcement Learning(TBD). I am currently employed at SPIRE Lab, IISc, Bangalore on a Speech recognition project on Indian languages, funded by Gates Foundatation. Previously, I worked at a startup - MyHealthcareAI, on various vision, NLP, speech DL tasks. 
<br>
I will be applying for Grad school for 2022 Fall intake. Do let me know if you think I'll be a good addition to your group!
