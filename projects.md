I used to be all over the place. Even now I feel like I'm spending too much time thinking on a wide range of topics !! 
Here are some major approaches I'm looking at right now-

<ul>
  <li>TTS - how to make existing algorithms more efficient? how to improve multilingual learning? How to improve the duration model?</li>
  <li>ASR - better alignments + deocding, improving multidialect/lingual learning</li>
  <li>Speech production - a multimodal architecture for speech production data</li>
</ul>
