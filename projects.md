Here are some of the things I'm currently working on:

<ul>
  <li>TTS, ASR with different Indian languages</li>
  <li>Speech, articulatory movement synthesis with transformers</li>
  <li>Audio-visual learning in a speech production setup</li>
  <li>Contributing to Speechbrain - TTS architectures, vocoders</li>
  <li>Visualising midsaggital plane of mouth during speech production</li>
</ul>

Feel free to reach out to me if you are interested in collaborating with me, always keen on different multi modal problems involving speech, vision and/or text.
